# Foundations of Astronomical Data Science - Class on Dec 10 and 11, 2025

Class based on the Software Carpentry lesson ["Foundations of Astronomical Data Science"](https://datacarpentry.github.io/astronomy-python/).

Instead of using GAIA data from the GAIA archive, this version uses SDSS data.

## Conda environment

After cloning with git this repository:

``` {bash}
git clone git@github.com:darioflute/AstronomicalData.git
```

Go into the directory AstronomicalData:

```{bash}
cd AstronomicalData
```

And create the environment with the command:

```{bash}
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment by running:

```{bash}
conda activate AstronomicalData
```

At this point, you can open Jupyter-lab:

```{bash}
jupyter-lab
```

And access the available notebooks.
